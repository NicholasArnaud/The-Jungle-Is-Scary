# The Jungle Is Scary
 The player must venture into the jungle with the help of his mysterious snake companion, and is used as a whip-like weapon. As he progresses through the jungle he has to overcome various obstacles, such as pitfalls and quicksand in order to reach the ancient ruins that reside deep within the jungle to retrieve a very powerful magical gem.
